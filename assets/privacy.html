<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
  Blastmud collects the following information that can be linked to individuals:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Whether or not you are over 18 years of age. This is used to ensure that
      we do not allow you access to games which cannot be made available to you.
      If you are under 18, the data is not retained. If you are over 18, this
      information is retained indefinitely.
    </li>
    <li>
      The IP address(es) you use to connect to Blastmud. These are used
      to block access to Blastmud from countries where we are not confident it can be legally provided,
      to check whether or not you are using an IP address that has been banned or restricted from the
      service or part of it, and to apply rate limits to prevent abuse. In normal circumstances, IP
      addresses are retained for up to 2 years, but if you are banned or restricted from the service,
      they are retained until up to 2 years after the ban or restriction is lifted. Bans and restrictions
      can be for an indefinite period, in which the IP address will be retained indefinitely.
    </li>
    <li>
      The IP address used to request an Over 18 certificate for running your own server.
      This will form part of the certificate issued. We keep records of all certificates issued,
      including the IP address, so that they can be revoked if they are leaked on the Internet.
    </li>
    <li>
      The email address you provide. This is retained indefinitely as an identifier for your
      account in case you contact us in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
      The character name you choose for yourself. We recommend not making this something
      linkable to your real identity, as it will be retained indefinitely and shown in-game to
      identify you to other players.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any free-form information you disclose while playing the game (for example, through in game
      communication functionality). Depending on the type of communication, this could be shared
      with other players and retained indefinitely. We recommend not posting any personally
      identifiable information through these channels.
    </li>
  </ul>
